/**
 * EnumSingleton is a Singleton implementation using an Enum.
 *  <br>
 * Advantages: <br>
 * 1. Provides a simple and concise way to implement a Singleton design pattern. <br>
 * 2. Enum inherently ensures thread safety and prevents reflection attacks. <br>
 * 3. Prevents the creation of multiple instances, even in the face of serialization/deserialization.<br>
 *
 * This approach is considered the best practice for implementing Singletons in Java,
 * as it resolves many of the issues with traditional Singleton implementations.
